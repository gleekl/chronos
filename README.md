## App Design
My aim was to create a HR management/timesheet application that has a stopwatch for each task for the day. 

Front end design was achieved using Material UI framework for styling. 

## User Stories
As someone who works in a tax department, I want to be able to record the time spent on every client down to the second, so I can have an accurate record on how much to bill each client. 

As a person who analyses my day-to-day workflow, I want to see how much time I spend on each project so I know how much time it takes to do certain projects.

As a business owner, I want to see how much time has been spent on each project as I have already been paid $XX.XX for XX number of hours and I want to see if my team needs more time which would require further payment from the client.


## Challenges
### PostgreSQL Database Relationships.
Learning PostgreSQL was definitely easier than when I was introduced to MongoDB. Having that initial exposure to a NoSQL database then moving on to an SQL database definitely helped. I am still currently working on learning about relational database and I certainly faced quite a few difficulties as I worked on the project. Initially, it was not too difficult. The difficulty came when I needed to make changes to the schemas of each data table. I saw that some of the initial relationships I made during the planning phase did not make sense when I finally got to the coding part of the project.

### Linking the stopwatch timer to the database
Currently, the stopwatch timer is not linked to the database and is currently just a plain timer. It is challenging to get it to work and to link it to the database but as of now, it is a WIP feature.
